## Installation

In the root directory..

- npm install
- bower install
- node server.js

The project will then be available locally on http://localhost:3000

## Watch out!!!
Watch out!!! I've hacked the webvr DPDB cache to not look online and to find my device.
You are likely to get better results running with the remote version of aframe.js rather than the one in this repo. Just uncomment it in `index.html` and comment over the local version. 

## Try it out

- Visit the link https://tam203.github.io/bubble-blast/
- If visiting from a mobile browser. Add the app to your homescreen.
- Open the app and off you go!
